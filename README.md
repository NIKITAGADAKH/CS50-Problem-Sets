# 💻 CS50 Problem Sets & Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository of CS50 problem set solutions and projects!  
I’m Nikita Gadakh, a Clinical Psychology postgraduate exploring the world of software development and building the skills needed to create technology that empowers people.



## 🚀 About This Repository
This repository documents my journey through Harvard University’s CS50: Introduction to Computer Science — one of the most comprehensive introductions to programming and computer science.  

It includes my personal solutions to problem sets, labs, and projects written in C, Python, and SQL, as well as notes and explorations of web technologies.



## 🎯 Current Goal
I’m currently preparing for a Software Engineer 
My focus is on mastering the fundamentals of computer science while building practical skills in:


- 🧠 CS50 (C, Python, SQL, Flask)
- ⚛️ React.js & Node.js
- 🐘 PostgreSQL
- ⛓️ Blockchain APIs


My goal is to contribute to crypto-forward, user-focused products that expand access to economic freedom through technology.



## 📚 Topics Covered in CS50
- C programming fundamentals (loops, conditionals, arrays, pointers)
- Algorithms (searching, sorting, recursion)
- Memory management and data structures
- Python programming and Flask web apps
- SQL databases and data management
- Final projects integrating multiple languages and tools



## 🗂️ Folder Structure
pset1/   → C basics (Hello, Mario, Cash)
pset2/   → Arrays and strings
pset3/   → Algorithms (sort, search)
pset4/   → Memory (filter, recover)
pset5/   → Data structures (speller)
pset6/   → Python
pset7/   → SQL and Flask
pset8/   → Final project

 
## 🧠 What I Learned
Through this course, I've developed:
- A deeper understanding of how computers work under the hood
- Strong problem-solving and logical reasoning skills 
- Real-world project development experience
- Confidence writing clean, efficient, and modular code
- Experience using debugging tools and reading error messages 
- The ability to learn complex technologies independently  


## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- C • Python • Flask  
- SQL • PostgreSQL  
- React.js • Node.js
- CS50 Library and IDE 
- Git & GitHub  
- Blockchain APIs (learning phase)  


## 🌱 Next Steps
- Complete CS50 and build full-stack projects using React + Node.js + PostgreSQL  
- Explore Web3 and blockchain development  
- Apply software engineering principles to real-world problems in crypto and finance  


## ✨ Acknowledgments
A huge thank you to the [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) team for creating such a powerful foundation for aspiring engineers.
