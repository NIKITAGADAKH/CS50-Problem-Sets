# 🧩 CS50 Notes — Computer Science
1. Computer Science

Computer Science is fundamentally about problem-solving.

Problem solving is the process of taking input (what we have) and generating output (what we want) using a process (the algorithm).


 

1.1 Representing Numbers

Unary: Each digit represents a single value.

Decimal: Uses ten digits (0–9) to count higher numbers.

Binary: The system computers use — only two digits (0 and 1).



1.2 Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of instructions for solving a problem efficiently.

Example:
Steps to find the largest number in a list → Compare each number → Keep track of the largest → Output it.

🧮 Representing Information in Computers

Computers understand only 0s and 1s — these are called bits.
A bit is the smallest unit of data and can be either:

0 → OFF

1 → ON


Think of bits like light switches — on or off.




🔢 Representing Numbers (Binary System)

The binary system is how computers count and represent numbers.
Here’s how we count in binary using 3 bits:

Decimal Binary

0 000
1 001
2 010
3 011
4 100
5 101
6 110
7 111


🧠 Note:
Each binary digit (bit) doubles in value from right to left — just like in decimal (ones → tens → hundreds).

Example in decimal:
123 = (1×100) + (2×10) + (3×1) = 123

Example in binary:
Each bit position represents powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, …).
So 101 = (1×4) + (0×2) + (1×1) = 5

To count higher than 7, we need more bits.
➡️ Most computers use 8 bits (1 byte) at a time.
Example: 00000011 = 3




🔤 Representing Text (ASCII & Unicode)

Computers can also represent letters and symbols using numbers.

✴️ ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)

Each character is assigned a number:

Character Decimal Binary

A 65 01000001
B 66 01000010
a 97 01100001
b 98 01100010




So when you type “A”, the computer actually stores 65 in binary form.



🌍 Unicode

ASCII was limited to English.
Unicode expanded this system to include:

All languages 🌐

Special symbols ©

Emojis 😄


When you send an emoji, your device actually sends a number, and your phone converts it into an emoji image based on the Unicode standard.




🖼️ Representing Images, Videos & Sounds

Computers use bits to represent every kind of media too!

🎨 Images:

Made up of tiny squares called pixels.

Each pixel has three color values — R (red), G (green), B (blue).

By mixing these, we get millions of colors.


🎞️ Videos:

A video is just a series of images shown very quickly (like 24–30 images per second).

Our eyes see smooth motion instead of still pictures.


🎵 Sounds & Music:

Sounds can be stored as numbers that represent their volume, pitch, and duration.

One common digital format is MIDI, which uses numbers for notes and timing.




🧩 Summary

Concept Description

Bit Smallest data unit (0 or 1)
Binary Number system using 0s and 1s
ASCII Mapping of numbers to English characters
Unicode Global standard for text and emojis
RGB Red, Green, Blue color system
Pixel Smallest dot of an image
MIDI Musical Instrument Digital Interface – represents music as numbers



💡 In short:
Everything — numbers, letters, photos, videos, music — is made up of 0s and 1s.
It’s all about how software interprets those bits!
